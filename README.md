## Data Source: https://www.census.gov/econ/cfs/pums.html

Address provided above also includes a data user's guide and data dictionary explaning the features and survey methodology.

## Jupyter Notebooks:

analysis - data cleaning and basic exploratory data analysis of the 2012 Commodity Flow Survey dataset. </br>
clustering - clustering analysis of truck deliveries 300 miles or less in routed distance.

## TODO:
- Assess emmisions impacts of electric truck deliveries using EPA data. What is the reduction in emissions in a volume/weight measure, and what societal cost does this represet? </br>
- Consider developing a classifier that identifies shipments that should be delivered via electric truck by identifying those that are the most benifital with regards to cost or emissions reduction. </br>
-  Is there some geographic area that would benefit the most from electric truck deployment?
